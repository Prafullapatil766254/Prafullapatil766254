# Experience

# -  Apprentice at Geekster


I'm currently an apprentice at Geekster, where I'm diving into a full-stack web development course. As of now, it introduced me to a bunch of cool things like Core Java, OOPs concept, Spring Boot, Hibernate, SQL, Amazon EC2, Git, GitHub, and many more to come.

As of now, I have solved more than 300 challenging Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions on the Geekster platform. It's been tough but super rewarding, as it's sharpened my problem-solving skills and given me a solid grasp of how algorithms work.

I've also had the chance to work on different projects using these technologies. I have created various projects based on spring boot and also used my SQL database for my projects and I also deployed a few of them on AWS EC2. It helped me a lot to gain more knowledge about the backend.
Looking ahead, I'm excited to keep learning and using my new skills on real projects. Full-stack web development has become a true passion, and I'm ready to take on more challenges and continue growing.
